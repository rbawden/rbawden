		    <p>The nature of the scenario (bilingual speakers with MT-mediated dialogue) means that the dataset contains
		    some specific features that cannot be found in many of the parallel corpora used for MT (those that are monolingual texts
                      that have been translated into the other language).
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-title"><a id="meta-conversations"></a>Meta-conversations and clarifications</h2>
                    <p>Meta-conversations and negotiating errors are one example of this. Although the MT systems were generally of good quality,
                      there were times when translation errors led to confusion. Even with the progress made in MT, this
                      is a scenario that is very likely to continue occurring (due to the use of specific vocabulary, spelling errors, non-standard use of language, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <p>Some examples of request for clarification:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>What kind of exchange do you mean?</li>
                      <li>I presume you mean lanes</li>
                      <li>Ok then, you mean do some lengths?</li>
                      <li>Do you mean dish?</li>
                      <li>Do you mean there are ten customers or are they late?</li>
                      <li>Tu veux dire des m√ªres ?</li>
                      <li>etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is important that clarifications get correctly translated. Otherwise it could lead to a breakdown in communication. It is
                    also important that when an alternative formlation is suggested (e.g. <span class="font-italic">I presume you mean lanes</span>) that the original user understands
                    that there has been an error and that this is a reformulation.</p>
                    <p>Citing wrong translations:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>But what do you mean by &quot;a piece of it&quot;?</li>
                      <li>What do you mean by the Thai limit?</li>
                      <li>Que voulez-vous dire exactement par &quot;bram&quot;... (What do you mean exactly by &quot;bram&quot;?)</li>
                      <li>Que voulez-vous dire par &quot;la pointe&quot;? (What do you mean by &quot;the point&quot;?)</li>
                      <li>What do you mean by &quot;draw three steps to one piece of bread in the water&quot;?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These examples are potentially problematic for translation, even from a theoretical point of view. How should
                      they be translated? The original user does not know that there has been an error in translation. If the citation
                      of the wrong translation is correctly translated back into the original language, then the original user
                      may not see that the misunderstanding is due to a translation error. However, if the citation is poorly translated, then
                      there could be further breakdowns in communication. It seems that the best option would be to have meta-information
                      indicating when there has been a translation error to avoid such problems.

                    <p>Another consequence of bilinguality is that in some cases, ambiguity in translation led to
                      requests for clarification that were very language-specific.
                    </p>
                    <h3><a id="lang-spec-gender"></a>Gendered nouns in French</h3>
                    <img style="width:500px;" alt="Language specificty (gender)" src="img/language-specificity.png">
                    <p>In this example, the French speaker corrects themself in the second utterance by making it clear
		    that the next patient is female (<span class="font-italic">patiente</span>) rather than male or
		    unspecified gender (<span class="font-italic">patient</span>) used in the first utterance. Since English
		    does not make such gender distinctions, the translation of both <span class="font-italic">patiente</span>
		    and <span class="font-italic">patient</span> is English <span class="font-italic">patient</span>, which
		    would result in a nonsensical sequence of sentences in English. Adding the words <span class="font-italic">male</span>
		    and <span class="font-italic">female</span> in front
                      of <span class="font-italic">patient</span> is an option, but this would only be know after the second utterance has been sent, since it would
                      be inappropriate to assume that French  <span class="font-italic">patient</span> is male in the general setting.
                    </p>
                    <h3><a id="lang-spec-ambig"></a>Language-specific ambiguity</h3>
                    <img style="width:500px;" alt="Language specificty ('glace')" src="img/language-specificity-glace.png">
		    <p>Language ambiguities sometimes hold across languages (e.g. English <span class="font-italic">crane</span>
		    ('bird', 'machine') and French
		    <span class="font-italic">grue</span> (bird, machine)),
                      but this it not always the case. In this example, the English speaker mentions <span class="font-italic">ice-cream</span>, which
                      translates into French <span class="font-italic">glace</span>. <span class="font-italic">Glace</span> is ambiguous in French, meaning either 'ice-cream' or
                      'mirror'. The French participant therefore asks for a clarification about which the English
                      speaker originally meant, resulting in a confusing conversation for the English speaker, for whom
                      the ambiguity did not exist. The confusion also arose in this scenario due to a slightly odd
translation of the original utterance (<span class="font-italic">penser &agrave; une glace</span>
rather than <span class="font-italic">penser &agrave; de la glace</span>).

                      quite serious problems.
                    </p>
		    <p>The following is an example of an omission in translation (<span class="font-italic">police</span>
		    rather than <span class="font-italic">BO police</span>),
                      resulting in a translation that is far less humorous than the original sentence.

                    <p>And while the above example got detected as being a poor translation (although maybe not
                      for the real reason), other errors (including those resulting in the complete opposite meaning)
		    can go completely undetected, as long as they are fluent and grammatical, which could lead to
		    some more serious and far-reaching problems:
